right but you don’t know what, perhaps talking about it in a safe and confidential environment is for

you.</Regular>


      <Regular>Whether you&#39;re having difficulties enjoying life, suffer from regular negative or intrusive thoughts,

are prone to feeling down and depressed, have in the past or are currently experiencing bullying,

abuse, sexual or domestic violence, I can offer a safe space to explore these feelings and work with

you to understand yourself and make changes happen.</Regular>


      <Regular>I believe that all of our actions and behaviour have a reason, and with therapy I can help you to

      understand those motivations and choose to take different actions with understanding and

      compassion for your processes and yourself.</Regular>


      <Regular>If you&#39;d like to find out more about what I can offer, you can read more about me (Link to about me)

      here, read about the types of therapy I offer here (link to What will therapy be like?) or Contact me
